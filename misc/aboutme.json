  "about": "Prior to attending Fullstack Academy, I was working on clinical trials in psychiatry research at the National Institutes of Health. While I was passionate about the work being done, I was dissatisfied with the day-to-day and could not see myself settling into a career in this field. After seeing many people around me learn to program without a formal CS degree, I began teaching myself some basic concepts using online resources, and was excited to find that I really enjoyed coding. After several months of practice, I applied and was accepted into Fullstack Academy, which I attended from April through July. Since graduation, I've been working as a teaching fellow there, a role that has entailed student project management, debugging, live code reviews, admissions interviews, and algorithm review. Through this program Iâ€™ve developed a deep understanding of Javascript, and have learned to build fully-functioning websites using a myriad of technologies including Node, Express, React, Redux, SQL, HTML, and CSS. After completing the fellowship on October 25th, I hope to get a job as a junior developer."
